### Preparation
# See README for necessary preparation steps.
# It is recommended that each set of examples be run only after cleaning up any previous examples.

### Health check and reaction examples
# All examples in this section require a deployed nagios server
# This can be accomplished using:
helper_scripts/deploy_nagios values
# All examples also use the basevalue blueprint:
cfy install -b basevalue -d basevalue -i snmptest-blueprint-inputs.yaml blueprints/basevalue.yaml
# Cleaning up:
cfy uninstall basevalue
helper_scripts/remove_nagios


#### 1 Healing node on exceeded threshold
# This demonstrates a node being healed when a monitored value is exceeded
# We'll make the test value that is being retrieved exceed the value
ssh -A -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no centos@$(cfy deployment outputs nagios | grep -A1 "External " | grep Value | awk '{ print $2 }') ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no centos@$(cfy node-instances get $(cfy node-instances list | grep basevalue | head -n1 | awk '{ print $2 }') | grep ip: | awk '{ print $2 }') echo 42 '">"' /tmp/cloudifytestinteger
# And confirm that the heal workflow triggers- this should happen within a few seconds
for i in {1..60}; do if ! cfy executions list | grep heal | grep started | grep basevalue ; then sleep 2; else break; fi; done; cfy events list --tail -e $(cfy executions list | grep heal | grep started | awk '{ print $2 }')


#### 2 Healing node on exceeded rate threshold
# This demonstrates a node being healed when a monitored rate is exceeded
# We'll make the rate increase beyond the critical threshold:
ssh -A -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no centos@$(cfy deployment outputs nagios | grep -A1 "External " | grep Value | awk '{ print $2 }') ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no centos@$(cfy node-instances get $(cfy node-instances list | grep basevalue | head -n1 | awk '{ print $2 }') | grep ip: | awk '{ print $2 }') echo $(date +%s):10 '">"' /tmp/cloudifytestcounter
# And confirm that the heal workflow triggers- this should happen within ~30 seconds
for i in {1..60}; do if ! cfy executions list | grep heal | grep started | grep basevalue ; then sleep 2; else break; fi; done; cfy events list --tail -e $(cfy executions list | grep heal | grep started | awk '{ print $2 }')

# Don't forget to run the nagios cleanup before you try another example
